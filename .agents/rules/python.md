# Python Rules

## Refactor/Deslop Safety

- Do not remove intentional feature logic introduced on the current branch just because it looks "extra" (for example new metadata models, typed payload helpers, or feature-specific abstractions).
- Before deleting newly added code, verify it is not part of the branch objective by checking nearby tests/call sites and the active user request.
- If style-cleanup instructions conflict with clear feature intent, preserve behavior first and ask a clarifying question instead of removing the feature code.

## Modern Syntax

- Use modern type hints: `str | None` instead of `Optional[str]`.
- Use built-in generics: `list[T]`, `dict[K, V]` instead of `List[T]`, `Dict[K, V]`.
- Use `Self` from `typing` for class method return types.
- Use `collections.abc` for abstract types: `Callable`, `Iterable`, etc.
- Never use `Protocol` for model typing; use concrete model classes in type annotations.

## Typed Data Shapes

- Never pass around arbitrary inline dictionaries for structured payloads (for example, job records or message envelopes).
- Use `TypedDict` for lightweight typed mappings when a dict shape is required.
- Use `BaseModel` when validation or serialization is needed.
- Never use `Any` in application or test type annotations; use the exact type (or a precise union) instead.
- If a shape is dynamic or nested, model it explicitly with `TypedDict` or `BaseModel` instead of falling back to `Any`.
- Avoid untyped `dict[str, object]` payload construction in service logic.
- Avoid `cast(...)` in application code; use real SDK/model types at call boundaries whenever possible.
- Use `cast(...)` only for true edge cases where type information cannot be expressed otherwise, and keep the cast narrowly scoped.
- For `TypedDict` fields and dict shapes produced from Pydantic models, never use `object` as a placeholder value type; use the exact value type (or a precise union) for each field.
- Do not "fix" typing by expanding simple transformations into repetitive key-by-key copy blocks (for example, manually assigning each dict key only to satisfy pyright). Fix the source type hints (or add a precise cast/narrowing at the boundary) so the transformation can stay concise and readable.
- For persistence/update payloads (for example, `upsert(...)`), define a dedicated `TypedDict` and construct it inline at the call site. Do not add free-floating `build_*`/`make_*` helper functions whose only role is constructing a payload from another shape; the same no-free-floating-builders rule that applies to `BaseModel` applies here.
- When a `TypedDict` types a module-level constant or other shared blob (for example a CVA style config), build the value by **calling** the TypedDict constructor with keyword arguments (`MyTypedDict(field=value, ...)`) instead of assigning an annotated plain dict literal (`name: MyTypedDict = {...}`). Use the same for nested TypedDict rows inside lists (for example `CompoundVariantRule(match={...}, class_name="...")`). This keeps the type as the construction site, not only a static annotation on a dict literal. Requires Python 3.12+.

```python
from typing import TypedDict

from pydantic import BaseModel

# Bad: implicit, untyped payload shape
payload = {"account_id": envelope.account_id, "status": "queued"}

# Good: TypedDict for mapping payloads
class JobPayload(TypedDict):
    account_id: str
    status: str

payload_typed: JobPayload = {
    "account_id": envelope.account_id,
    "status": "queued",
}

# Good: BaseModel when validation/serialization is useful
class JobPayloadModel(BaseModel):
    account_id: str
    status: str

payload_for_insert = JobPayloadModel(
    account_id=envelope.account_id,
    status="queued",
).model_dump()

# Good: dedicated TypedDict for DB payloads, constructed inline at the call site
class JobUpsertPayload(TypedDict):
    account_id: str
    user_id: str
    status: str

payload_for_upsert = JobUpsertPayload(
    account_id=envelope.account_id,
    user_id=envelope.user_id,
    status="queued",
)

# Bad: free-floating builder whose only role is constructing the payload
def build_job_upsert_payload(*, account_id: str, user_id: str) -> JobUpsertPayload:
    return JobUpsertPayload(
        account_id=account_id,
        user_id=user_id,
        status="queued",
    )

# Bad: object hides the real field type contract
class SubscriberSyncPayloadBad(TypedDict):
    subscriber_id: object
    is_active: object
    tags: object

# Good: use exact types (or precise unions)
class SubscriberSyncPayload(TypedDict):
    subscriber_id: str
    is_active: bool
    tags: list[str]

class SubscriberSyncBody(BaseModel):
    subscriber_id: str
    is_active: bool
    tags: list[str]

payload_from_model: SubscriberSyncPayload = SubscriberSyncBody(
    subscriber_id="sub_123",
    is_active=True,
    tags=["priority"],
).model_dump()
```

## Date & Time

- Use `datetime` objects instead of raw integers (Unix timestamps) for representing time.
- Use `timedelta` for durations instead of raw integers (for example, `timedelta(seconds=10)` instead of `10`).
- For database columns, use `DateTime` or `Date` types from SQLAlchemy.
- For Pydantic models, use `datetime.datetime` or `datetime.date` types.

## Imports

- Keep ALL imports at the top of the file.
- Never import inside functions, methods, or test cases.
- Group imports: stdlib, third-party, local (separated by blank lines).
- Prefer **absolute imports** from the top-level package (for example `from myapp.routes.users import router`) over **relative imports** with parent segments (for example `from ....routes.users import router`). Absolute imports are stable when modules move, easier to grep, and avoid brittle `..` depth. Same rule applies to other installable packages: always anchor imports on the package name, not on the file’s directory depth.
- Never use import aliases for project modules; import the canonical symbol/module name and update call sites to that name instead of aliasing.
- Use `__all__` exports in module `__init__.py` files.
- Never define variables or call functions in between import statements; all imports must be contiguous at the top of the file.
- Never create shim modules that only re-export symbols from another package for backwards compatibility; update all consumers to import from the canonical source instead.
- Narrow exception: `__main__.py` entrypoints may use same-package relative imports for bootstrap (for example `from .runtime import main`), and `__init__.py` may use explicit relative imports when assembling the package’s public surface.

```python
# Bad: shim module that only re-exports symbols
from .http_transport import fetch, fetch_with_cache

__all__ = ["fetch", "fetch_with_cache"]

# Bad: consuming through a shim module
from myapp.http import fetch

# Good: import from the canonical source directly
from myapp.http_transport import fetch
```

## Static analysis (Pylint, type checkers)

- Prefer real fixes (annotations, stubs, deps). If a Pylint/static warning is a false positive or unfixable in our code (for example lazy third-party exports, missing stubs), use a **narrow** suppression: `# pylint: disable-next=<message-id>` on the smallest scope—never file-wide disables or import workarounds whose only purpose is to satisfy the checker.

```python
# pylint: disable-next=not-callable
config = third_party_package.Config(
    app_name="example",
)
```

## Constants

- Define constants at the top of the file, after imports.
- Place module-level constants and enums (including type aliases like `AllowedApiClient`) directly after imports.
- Use `Final[T]` type annotation from `typing` for constants.
- When a mutable object is annotated with `Final`, complete any setup-time mutation in the same expression as initialization instead of binding it first and mutating it on the next line.
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE naming convention for constants.
- Only extract literals to constants when they are reused, configurable, or carry domain meaning; keep trivial single-use literals inline (for example, delimiters like `"-"` or `"."`).
- Never hard-code constants like HTTP status codes; use `HTTPStatus` from the `http` module instead.
- Prefer enums for error identifiers/messages instead of a constant per error string.

## Config Maps vs Constants

- A group of related **configuration values** (API hosts, endpoint paths, protocol versions, header tokens, feature markers, default model names, timeouts) is not a set of constants — collect it into a **single typed config map**, not one `Final` per value.
- Model the map with a `TypedDict` and build it by **calling** the constructor with keyword arguments (`CONFIG: Final[ReviewConfig] = ReviewConfig(...)`), then read values by key (`CONFIG["routine_host"]`). Do not annotate a plain dict literal.
- Reserve standalone `Final` constants for genuinely single, unrelated constants — a compiled regex, a file path, a sentinel — that do not belong to a config group.
- This is about grouping; it does not override the **Configuration** section below. Environment-backed values, or values that belong in the repository's central settings layer, still go there — not in a module-level map.

```python
from typing import Final, TypedDict

# Bad: one config group spread across many individual constants
ROUTINE_HOST: Final[str] = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/claude_code/routines"
ANTHROPIC_VERSION: Final[str] = "2023-06-01"
ROUTINE_BETA: Final[str] = "experimental-cc-routine-2026-04-01"
REVIEW_MARKER: Final[str] = "<!-- code-review:cursor -->"

# Good: one typed config map, built by calling the TypedDict constructor
class ReviewConfig(TypedDict):
    routine_host: str
    anthropic_version: str
    routine_beta: str
    review_marker: str


CONFIG: Final[ReviewConfig] = ReviewConfig(
    routine_host="https://api.anthropic.com/v1/claude_code/routines",
    anthropic_version="2023-06-01",
    routine_beta="experimental-cc-routine-2026-04-01",
    review_marker="<!-- code-review:cursor -->",
)
```

## Leading underscore (private names)

- Use a leading underscore **only** for nested definitions: a function defined inside another function or method (inner function), and a class defined inside another class (inner class).
- Everything else must **not** start with a leading underscore. This includes module-level functions, classes, Pydantic/ORM models, enums, `TypedDict`s, type aliases, and constants; **methods** (instance methods, `@classmethod`, and `@staticmethod`); and **module / file names**.
- Do not use a leading underscore to mark a method or a module-level helper as "private". Express privacy through module boundaries and `__all__` instead.
- This rule does not govern Python dunders (`__init__`, `__enter__`, …) or single-underscore names owned by third-party/stdlib code.

```python
def build_report(rows: list[Row]) -> Report:
    def _format_row(row: Row) -> str:
        return f"{row.id}: {row.name}"

    return Report(lines=[_format_row(row) for row in rows])
```

## Configuration

- Configuration settings (allowed environments, feature flags, API hosts, limits, etc.) should live in the repository's typed configuration layer, not as scattered module-level constants in service files.
- Avoid large piles of module-level constants. If a value is configurable, add it to the project's central config model or settings layer.
- Do not add useless config values like `DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT`.
- Do not add helper functions like `_get_environment` when the value already exists on `CONFIG`.
- Do not read environment variables directly with `os.getenv`, `os.environ`, or `os.environ.get` in application/service/library code.
- Always read environment-backed values from the typed config object so defaults, validation, and normalization live in one place.
- Exception: one-off scripts may read from `os` when introducing a `CONFIG` model would be unnecessary overhead.

## Helper Functions

Avoid trivial wrapper functions that add no value. A function that just returns its argument or applies a trivial fallback is noise:

- Do not rebind function arguments to a second local name when the value is unchanged (for example, `profile = obj`); name the parameter correctly at the signature instead.
- Do not add passthrough function or method parameters when every call site provides the value from one shared source (for example, forwarding `timeout_seconds` from `CONFIG` in every call); read from that source directly where the value is used.

## Model Mutation

- Prefer normal attribute assignment over `object.__setattr__(...)` when mutating Pydantic models in validators or helper methods.
- Only use `object.__setattr__(...)` when normal assignment is genuinely unavailable (for example frozen models or descriptor bypass requirements), and keep that escape hatch explicit and justified.

```python
# Bad: useless wrapper
def resolve_config(config: Settings | None) -> Settings:
    return config or CONFIG

def get_auth_secret(config: Settings | None = None) -> str:
    resolved = resolve_config(config)  # Unnecessary indirection
    return resolved.SECRET

# Good: inline the fallback
def get_auth_secret(config: Settings | None = None) -> str:
    resolved = config or CONFIG
    return resolved.SECRET
```

## Third-Party SDK Methods

- Verify SDK method availability before coding integrations:
  - Prefer checking official docs with `@Browser`, or
  - Inspect the installed SDK directly (for example with Python `inspect`/`hasattr`) in the current environment.
- Do not add defensive attribute checks or fallback branches for third-party SDK methods (for example, catching `AttributeError` to try an alternate call path).
- Call the expected SDK method directly; if the integration changes, update it explicitly rather than supporting multiple speculative shapes in runtime code.

```python
# Bad: speculative fallback for a "maybe async, maybe sync" SDK shape
try:
    memberships = await sdk.memberships.list_async(
        org_id=org_id,
        user_id=[user_id],
        limit=1,
    )
except AttributeError:
    membership = sdk.memberships.get(
        org_id=org_id,
        user_id=user_id,
    )

# Good: call the expected method directly
memberships = await sdk.memberships.list_async(
    org_id=org_id,
    user_id=[user_id],
    limit=1,
)
```

## No Placeholder Values in Application Code

- Never insert fabricated placeholder values (for example `user-{id}@blank.com`) into database columns in application code to satisfy NOT NULL or UNIQUE constraints.
- If a required field is unavailable at a code path, fetch the real value from its authoritative source (for example an external identity provider API) or make the caller supply it.
- Placeholder backfills for legacy data belong exclusively in database migrations, not in runtime service logic.

## Complete Implementations (No Backwards-Compatible Branches)

- Implement only the single contract used by the current boundary (database schema, SDK contract, or API model).
- Do not widen types or add compatibility branches for alternate shapes that are not part of the real contract.
- Example: If the DB column type is `UUID`, function parameters and call sites should use `UUID` only (not `UUID | str` with runtime conversion).
- Prefer fixing call sites to provide the correct type over adding defensive conversion logic in core helpers.

```python
# Bad: backward-compatible branch for an unsupported secondary shape
async def get_external_id_from_db(session: AsyncSession, user_id: UUID | str) -> str | None:
    resolved_user_id = UUID(user_id) if isinstance(user_id, str) else user_id
    user = await User.get_one(session, where=User.id == resolved_user_id)
    ...

# Good: single, complete implementation aligned to DB contract
async def get_external_id_from_db(session: AsyncSession, user_id: UUID) -> str | None:
    user = await User.get_one(session, where=User.id == user_id)
    ...

# Good call site: convert once at boundary
raw_user_id = response.json()["data"]["user_id"]
external_id = await get_external_id_from_db(session, UUID(raw_user_id))
```

## No Silent Fallbacks (Use Canonical Sources)

- Read required data from its single canonical source — an SDK catalog/list call, a typed config value, a generated client — and use it directly. The implementation must be complete against that source, not hedged with a fallback.
- Do not wrap a canonical lookup in a `try`/`except` that swallows the failure and continues with a guessed value, a default, or a degraded mode. That hides drift and turns a real outage into silently wrong behavior. Let a genuine failure propagate to the normal error path so it fails loudly and gets fixed at the root.
- Handling a legitimate, expected *state* of the canonical data is fine (for example, a catalog entry that has no optional variant, so you use the base value). Inventing a substitute when the source is *unavailable or malformed* is not.
- If you catch yourself writing "if the lookup fails, use X instead", the fix is to make the lookup reliable (or to fail), not to paper over it with a fallback branch.

```python
# Bad: swallow a catalog failure and silently degrade to the default behavior
try:
    catalog = await client.list_models()
    variant = pick_variant(catalog)
except SomeError:
    variant = None  # silently falls back to the wrong/default behavior

# Good: use the canonical source completely; a real failure propagates to the caller's error path
catalog = await client.list_models()
variant = pick_variant(catalog)
```

## Caching Runtime Data

- Never use plain dictionaries (module-level, class-level, or any other in-process container) as caches for data that must stay correct across requests, workers, or deployments. In-process dict caches silently go stale, diverge between workers, and cannot be invalidated remotely.
- For cross-request or cross-process caching, use Redis (for example `ResponseCache` from the shared caching layer) or another distributed caching library, and always set an explicit TTL.
- Pair every cache write path with an explicit invalidation path for mutations that change the cached value.
- Request-scoped memoization is the only acceptable dict-shaped cache: it must be held in a `ContextVar`, reset at the start of every request, and invalidated on writes within the request.
## Caching Deterministic Builders

- Use `@cache` (from `functools`) for expensive, deterministic builders that should be created once per process (for example, AI agents, parsed static configs, immutable lookup tables).
- Only cache functions whose return value is safe to reuse and does not depend on request-scoped state.
- Do not cache values that depend on mutable runtime inputs (per-request user data, DB sessions, auth context, timestamps).
- Keep cached builders side-effect free and parameter-light.

```python
from functools import cache

@cache
def build_classification_agent() -> Agent[None, ClassificationResult]:
    return Agent(...)
```

## Stable Durable Identifiers

- For values persisted in databases, queues, or cross-service contracts (for example handler names, event names, state keys), use explicit constants or enums.
- Do not derive durable identifiers from implementation details like `function.__name__`.
- Keep durable identifiers in shared model/contract modules when they are used across services.

```python
from enum import StrEnum


class JobHandlerKey(StrEnum):
    EXPORT_REPORT = "export_report"

# Good: explicit durable key
register_job(job_type=JobType.REPORT_EXPORT, handler_name=JobHandlerKey.EXPORT_REPORT.value)

# Bad: fragile runtime-derived key
register_job(job_type=JobType.REPORT_EXPORT, handler_name=handler.__name__)
```

## Entry Point Design

- Keep `__main__.py` and script entrypoints thin.
- Entrypoints should only bootstrap and call a `main()` function from a dedicated runtime/service module.
- Place orchestration loops, transaction flow, and business logic in regular modules, not in the entrypoint file.

```python
# __main__.py
from .runtime import main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Service Module Boundaries

- Avoid monolithic service modules that mix orchestration, third-party API calls, policy decisions, and data mappers.
- Split large services into focused modules, for example:
  - orchestration module (route-facing flow)
  - gateway module (external/internal API client calls)
  - domain helper modules (policy/state decisions, AI resolution, etc.)
- Keep public service function signatures stable while refactoring internals.

## Shared Derived-State Helpers

- When multiple functions compute the same derived state (for example completion/missing stage lists), centralize that logic in one helper.
- Reuse the helper across read paths to avoid behavior drift.

## Test Seams for Refactors

- Keep explicit wrapper/helper functions for external dependencies so tests can patch clear module boundaries.
- Prefer patching module-level seams (for example `payment_service.charge_card`) over patching deep nested internals.

## Formatting

- Add a blank line after each docstring.
- Never add decorative separator comments (for example, `# -----` headers).
- Add a blank line after multi-line statements (function calls, context managers, etc.) before the next statement.
- Add a blank line before terminating statements (`sys.exit()`, `return`, `raise`) to visually separate them from preceding code.
- Keep consecutive lines together only when they form one cohesive setup or transformation step (for example, related variable definitions or configuring the same object).
- Insert a blank line whenever adjacent statements advance to a different responsibility, even when both statements are short. In particular, separate an action from logging or other reporting; separate construction of an object from configuring or using it; and separate each independently configured parser or command group from the next.
- At module scope, separate runtime collaborators such as loggers from subsequent constants, type aliases, enum declarations, or configuration data. Keep the declarations together only when they form their own cohesive group.
- A short compact block (2–3 lines) may stay together only when every line directly contributes to the same operation. Do not use compactness alone as a reason to remove a logical boundary.
- When consecutive lines switch to a different statement kind (for example `assert` to a mock-verification call, or `setattr(...)` to an assignment), insert a blank line at the transition.
- Add a blank line after setup/initialization code before the main logic begins.

```python
# Good: blank line separates setup from main logic
versions_dir = tmp_path / "versions"
versions_dir.mkdir()

create_migration_file(versions_dir, "rev1", None)
create_migration_file(versions_dir, "rev2", "rev1")

# Bad: no separation between setup and main logic
versions_dir = tmp_path / "versions"
versions_dir.mkdir()
create_migration_file(versions_dir, "rev1", None)
```

- Add a blank line before multi-line assert statements.
- Do NOT put docstrings or comments at the top of files (no module-level docstrings, no module-level comments, and no encoding header comments like `# coding: utf-8`); `__init__.py` files should either be empty or contain only imports and `__all__`.

## Conditionals

- Combine conditional branches with `or` when they have the same body (including separate `if` statements and `if`/`elif` chains).
- Do not use an `if`/`else` block just to choose which attribute or mapping values to read. When the goal is only to select a source object and then read the same fields, resolve the source once with `or` and read from that single variable.

```python
# Good: combined conditions in one branch
if not current_user.account_id or current_user.account_id != account_id:
    raise PermissionError("User is not in the account")

# Bad: separate branches with identical bodies
if not current_user.account_id:
    raise PermissionError("User is not in the account")

if current_user.account_id != account_id:
    raise PermissionError("User is not in the account")
```

```python
# Good: resolve the source once, then read fields once
request_payload = request or {"name": ""}
resolved_name = request_payload["name"]
resolved_slug = request_payload.get("slug") or ""

# Bad: duplicated field extraction across branches
if request is None:
    resolved_name = ""
    resolved_slug = ""
else:
    resolved_name = request["name"]
    resolved_slug = request.get("slug") or ""
```

## Collection Search

- For find-first patterns, use `next()` with a generator expression instead of a `for` loop with a nested `if` and early `return`/`break`.
- For filtering, prefer generator expressions or `filter(...)` over `for` loops that conditionally append to a list.

```python
# Bad: for loop with trivial nested if for find-first
for item in items:
    if item.id == target_id:
        return item.value

# Good: next() with generator expression
return next(
    (item.value for item in items if item.id == target_id),
    None,
)
```

## Pattern Matching

- Use `match` statement instead of chains of `if`/`elif` statements when dispatching on enum members or discriminant values.
- For data-driven column/field selection with many independent boolean flags, prefer a declarative mapping iterated in a loop over repeated `if` blocks.
- Use enums with descriptive string values for column names, header labels, and other user-facing strings instead of raw string literals scattered across functions.

## Logging

- Use the `logging` module instead of `print()` statements in all code, including scripts and CLI tools.
- Configure a logger at the top of each module: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`.
- Use appropriate log levels: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`.
- Never use `print()` for debugging, status messages, progress, or diagnostics — use `logger` instead.

## Docstrings

- Every **function**, **method**, and **class** should have a one-line docstring (purpose or role). Include `main()` and nested helpers the same way unless the file’s existing style omits docstrings on tiny locals—when in doubt, add one line.
- Keep docstrings to a single line. Do not include Args, Returns, or Raises sections.
- Class docstrings go directly after the class definition.
- Docstrings describe current behavior only — never reference what the code replaces, used to do, or PR/migration history. The docstring must read the same to a new reader who never saw the prior version.

## Comments

- Default to writing no comments. Only add one when the WHY is non-obvious: a hidden constraint, a subtle invariant, a workaround for a specific bug, or behavior that would surprise a reader.
- Comments describe current behavior only — never reference what the code replaces, used to do, what was deleted, or PR/migration history. Phrases like "previously…", "was the…", "legacy…", "replaces the hand-built…", "now uses X instead of Y" do not belong in source. They rot the moment the comparison ages out.
- A comment should read the same to someone who never saw the prior version of the file. If you find yourself explaining a transition, put that in the PR description, not the code.
- Don't explain WHAT the code does — well-named identifiers already do that. Don't reference the current task, fix, or callers ("used by X", "added for the Y flow", "handles the case from issue #123") since those belong in the PR description.

## HTTP Status Codes

- Use `HTTPStatus` enum from the `http` module instead of raw integer status codes.
- Import as: `from http import HTTPStatus`.
- Use your framework's standard error response type instead of hand-rolled JSON response bodies when the project already defines one.

```python
from http import HTTPStatus

# Good: use a typed or framework-standard error response
raise HttpError(
    status_code=HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND,
    detail="Resource not found",
)

# Bad: using raw integer status code with JSONResponse
return JSONResponse(
    status_code=404,
    content={"error": "Resource not found"},
)
```

## Exception Handling

- Never catch bare `Exception`; always catch specific exception types unless that broad exception is being explicitly tested in a test case.
- For generated or SDK-backed API clients, catch the library's documented exception type instead of broad exceptions.

```python
import third_party_client

# Good: catch specific exception
try:
    response = await client.get_resource(...)
except third_party_client.ApiException as exc:
    logger.warning("Resource API call failed: %s", exc)

# Bad: catch all exceptions
try:
    response = await client.get_resource(...)
except Exception as exc:
    logger.warning("API call failed: %s", exc)
```

## Enums

- Prefer string enums for string-valued domains instead of loose string constants.

```python
from enum import StrEnum

# Good: string enum
class ReportType(StrEnum):
    DAILY_SUMMARY = "daily-summary"
    MONTHLY_INVOICE = "monthly-invoice"

# Bad: loose string constants spread across modules
DAILY_SUMMARY = "daily-summary"
MONTHLY_INVOICE = "monthly-invoice"
```
